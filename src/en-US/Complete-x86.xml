	<title>Installation Complete</title>

		Congratulations! Your &PRODUCT; installation is now complete!
	</para>

	<para>
		Click the <guibutton>Reboot</guibutton> button to reboot your system and begin using &PRODUCT;. Remember to remove any installation media if it is not ejected automatically upon reboot.

	<para>
		After your computer's normal power-up sequence has completed,
		&PRODUCT; loads and starts. By default,
		the start process is hidden behind a graphical screen that displays
		a progress bar. Eventually, a GUI login screen (or if the X Window
		System is not installed, a <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt) appears.
	</para>

	<para>
		If your system was installed with the X Window System during this installation process, the first time you start your &PRODUCT; system, applications to set up your system are launched. These applications guide you through initial configuration of &PRODUCT; and allow you to set your system time and date, register your machine with Red&nbsp;Hat Network, and more.

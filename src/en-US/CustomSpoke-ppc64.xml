  <para>
    The <guilabel>Manual Partitioning</guilabel> screen is displayed when you click <guibutton>Done</guibutton> from Installation Destination if you selected the <guilabel>I will configure partitioning</guilabel> option. On this screen you configure your disk partitions and mount points. This defines the file system that &PRODUCT; will be installed on.

      Red&nbsp;Hat recommends that you always back up any data that you have on your systems. For example, if you are upgrading or creating a dual-boot system, you should back up any data you want to keep on your storage devices. Unforeseen circumstances can result in loss of all your data.

  <para>
    The <guilabel>Manual Partitioning</guilabel> screen initially features a single pane on the left for the mount points. The pane is either empty except for information about creating mount points, or it displays existing mount points that the installation program has detected. These mount points are organized by detected operating system installations. Therefore, some file systems might be displayed multiple times if a partition is shared among several installations. The total space and available space on selected storage devices are displayed beneath this pane.
  </para>

  <para>
    If your system contains existing file systems, ensure that enough space will be available for the installation. Use the <guibutton>-</guibutton> button to remove unneeded partitions.
  </para>


  <note>
    <para>
      For recommendations and additional information about disk partitions, see <xref linkend="appe-disk-partitions-overview"/> and <xref linkend="sect-recommended-partitioning-scheme-ppc"/>. At a bare minimum, you need an appropriately sized root partition, and usually a swap partition appropriate to the amount of RAM you have on your system.

    <para>
      An installation of &PRODUCT; requires a PReP boot partition and one other partition but Red&nbsp;Hat recommends at least five: <systemitem>PReP</systemitem>, <systemitem>/</systemitem>, <systemitem>/home</systemitem>, <systemitem>/boot</systemitem>, and <systemitem>swap</systemitem>. You can also create additional partitions you require. See <xref linkend="sect-recommended-partitioning-scheme-ppc"/> for further details.
    </para>

    <para>
      <note>
        <para>
          If you have any specific requirements for some partitions (for example, requiring that a particular partition be on a specific disk) and less specific requirements for other partitions, create the partitions first which have more specific requirements.
        </para>
      </note>
      Adding a file system is a two-step process. You first create a mount point in a certain partitioning scheme. The mount point appears in the left pane. Next, you can customize it using the options in the right pane, where you can change the mount point, capacity, the device type, file system type, label, and whether to encrypt or reformat the corresponding partition.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you have no existing file systems and want the installation program to create the required file systems and their mount points for you, select your preferred partitioning scheme from the drop-down menu in the left pane (default for &PRODUCT; is LVM), then click the link on top of the pane for creating mount points automatically. This will generate a <filename>/boot</filename> partition, a <filename>/</filename> (root) volume, and a swap volume proportionate to the size of the available storage. These are the recommended file systems for a typical installation, but you can add additional file systems and mount points if you need to.
    </para>

    <para>
      Alternatively, create individual mount points using the <guibutton>+</guibutton> button at the bottom of the pane. The <guilabel>Add a New Mount Point</guilabel> dialog then opens. Either select one of the preset paths from the <guilabel>Mount Point</guilabel> drop-down menu or type your own; for example, select <filename>/</filename> for the root partition or <filename>/boot</filename> for the boot partition. Then enter the size of the file system in the <guilabel>Desired Capacity</guilabel> text field; for example, <literal>2GiB</literal>. If you leave the field empty or if you specify a size bigger than available space, all remaining free space is used instead. After entering these details, click the <guibutton>Add mount point</guibutton> button to create the partition.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        To avoid problems with space allocation, first create small partitions with known fixed sizes, such as <filename>/boot</filename>, and then create the rest of the partitions, letting the installation program allocate the remaining capacity to them.
      </para>
      <para>
        Similarly, if you have multiple disks that the system is to reside on, they differ in size, and a particular partition must be created on the first disk detected by BIOS, be sure to start by creating such a partition.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      For each new mount point you create manually, you can set its partitioning scheme from the drop-down menu located in the left pane. The available options are <literal>Standard Partition</literal>, <literal>BTRFS</literal>, <literal>LVM</literal>, and <literal>LVM Thin Provisioning</literal>. Note that the <filename>/boot</filename> partition will always be located on a standard partition, regardless of the value selected in this menu.
    </para>

    <para>
      To change on which devices a single non-LVM mount point should be located, select the mount point and click the <guilabel>Modify...</guilabel> button in the right pane to open the <guilabel>Configure Mount Point</guilabel> dialog. Select one or more devices and click <guibutton>Select</guibutton>. After the dialog closes, note that you also need to confirm this setting by clicking the <guibutton>Update Settings</guibutton> button on the right side of the <guilabel>Manual Partitioning</guilabel> screen.

      <para>
        If <filename>/usr</filename> or <filename>/var</filename> is partitioned separately from the rest of the root volume, the boot process becomes much more complex because these directories contain components critical to it. In some situations, such as when these directories are placed on an iSCSI drive or an FCoE location, the system can either be unable to boot, or hang with a <computeroutput>Device is busy</computeroutput> error when powering off or rebooting.
      </para>
      <para>
        This limitation only applies to <filename>/usr</filename> or <filename>/var</filename>, not to directories below them. For example, a separate partition for <filename>/var/www</filename> will work without issues.

    <para>
      <firstterm>Redundant arrays of independent disks</firstterm> (RAIDs) are constructed from multiple storage devices that are arranged to provide increased performance and, in some configurations, greater fault tolerance. See below for a description of different kinds of RAIDs.
    </para>

    <para>
      A RAID device is created in one step and disks are added or removed as necessary. One RAID partition per physical disk is allowed for each device, so the number of disks available to the installation program determines which levels of RAID device are available to you. For example, if your system has two hard drives, the installation program will not allow you to create a RAID10 device, which requires 4 separate partitions.

                Distributes data across multiple disks. Level 0 RAIDs offer increased performance over standard partitions, and can be used to pool the storage of multiple disks into one large virtual device. Note that Level 0 RAIDs offer no redundancy, and that the failure of one device in the array destroys data in the entire array. RAID 0 requires at least two RAID partitions.

    <para>
      <firstterm>Logical Volume Management</firstterm> (LVM) presents a simple logical view of underlying physical storage space, such as hard drives or LUNs. Partitions on physical storage are represented as <firstterm>physical volumes</firstterm> that can be grouped together into <firstterm>volume groups</firstterm>. Each volume group can be divided into multiple <firstterm>logical volumes</firstterm>, each of which is analogous to a standard disk partition. Therefore, LVM logical volumes function as partitions that can span multiple physical disks.

        <term>A PReP boot partition - recommended size of 4 to 8 MiB</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The first partition of the hard drive should include a PReP boot partition. This contains the <application>GRUB2</application> boot loader, which allows other IBM Power&nbsp;Systems servers to boot &PRODUCT;.

        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The partition mounted on <filename>/boot</filename> contains the operating system kernel, which allows your system to boot &PRODUCT;, along with files used during the bootstrap process. Due to the limitations of most firmwares, creating a small partition to hold these is recommended. In most scenarios, a 1 GiB boot partition is adequate. Unlike other mount points, using an LVM volume for <filename>/boot</filename> is not possible - <filename>/boot</filename> must be located on a separate disk partition.
          </para>



          <note>
            <para>
              If you have a RAID card, be aware that some BIOS types do not support booting from the RAID card. In such a case, the <filename>/boot</filename> partition must be created on a partition outside of the RAID array, such as on a separate hard drive.

            This is where "<filename>/</filename>", or the root directory, is located. The root directory is the top-level of the directory structure. By default, all files are written to this file system unless a different file system is mounted in the path being written to (for example, <filename class="partition">/boot</filename> or <filename class="partition">/home</filename>).
          </para>
          <para>
            While a 5&nbsp;GiB root file system allows you to install a minimal installation, it is recommended to allocate at least 10&nbsp;GiB so that you can install as many package groups as you want.

          <para>
            To store user data separately from system data, create a dedicated file system for the <filename>/home</filename> directory. This file system should be sized based on the amount of data that will be stored locally, number of users, and so on. This will enable you to upgrade or reinstall &PRODUCT; without erasing user data files. If you select automatic partitioning, it is recommended to have at least 55GiB of disk space available for the installation, to ensure that the <filename class="partition">/home</filename> file system is created.

        <term><filename>swap</filename> partition - recommended size at least 1 GB</term>
        <listitem>

          <para>
            Swap file systems support virtual memory; data is written to a swap file system when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing. Swap size is a function of system memory workload, not total system memory and therefore is not equal to the total system memory size. Therefore, it is important to analyze what applications a system will be running and the load those applications will serve in order to determine the system memory workload. Application providers and developers should be able to provide some guidance.
          </para>

          <para>
            When the system runs out of swap space, the kernel terminates processes as the system RAM memory is exhausted. Configuring too much swap space results in storage devices being allocated but idle and is a poor use of resources. Too much swap space can also hide memory leaks. The maximum size for a swap partition and other additional information can be found in the <systemitem>mkswap(8)</systemitem> manual page.
          </para>

          <para>
            The following table provides the recommended size of a swap partition depending on the amount of RAM in your system. If you let the installation program partition your system automatically, the swap partition size will be established using these guidelines. Automatic partitioning setup assumes that the maximum size of the swap partition is limited to 10% of the total size of the hard drive, and the installer cannot create swap partitions more than 128GB in size. If you want to set the swap partition size to more than 10% of the system's storage space, or more than 128GB, you must edit the partitioning layout manually.

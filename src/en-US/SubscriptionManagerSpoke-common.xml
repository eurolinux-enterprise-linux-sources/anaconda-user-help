    The products installed on a system (including the operating system itself) are covered by <emphasis>subscriptions</emphasis>. A subscription service is used to track registered systems, the products installed on those systems, and the subscriptions <emphasis>attached</emphasis> to the system to cover those products. Red&nbsp;Hat provides several different subscription services which a system can registered with:

      <para>
        Customer Portal Subscription Management, hosted services from Red&nbsp;Hat (the default)
      </para>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        Subscription Asset Manager, an on-premise subscription server which proxies content delivery back to the Customer Portal's services
      </para>
    </listitem>

      <para>
        CloudForms System Engine, an on-premise service which handles both subscription services and content delivery

  <para>
    The <guilabel>Subscription Manager</guilabel> screen provides a basic interface which is suitable for most use cases. In some scenarios, you require options which are not present in <application>Initial Setup</application>; in that case, you can skip the post-installation registration process and use <application>Subscription Manager</application> from the command line or using the <package>subscription-manager-gui</package> package which provides a graphical interface.
  </para>
  <para>
    Also note that some registration scenarios, such as registering using CloudForms System Engine, require additional setup steps - you must have a registration server ready before registering your system.
  </para>

    To register your system, follow on-screen instructions, providing your credentials when prompted. Note that if you want to leave the <guilabel>Subscription Manager</guilabel> screen and return to the main <application>Initial Setup</application> screen, you must use the <guilabel>Done</guilabel> button in the top left corner of the screen, not the <guilabel>Back</guilabel> or <guilabel>Next</guilabel> buttons in the main window.

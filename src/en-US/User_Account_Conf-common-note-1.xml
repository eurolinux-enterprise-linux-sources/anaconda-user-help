		Consider setting IDs of regular users and their default groups at range starting at <literal>5000</literal> instead of <literal>1000</literal>. That is because the range reserved for system users and groups, <literal>0</literal>-<literal>999</literal>, might increase in the future and thus overlap with IDs of regular users.

		For changing the minimum UID and GID limits after the installation, which ensures that your chosen UID and GID ranges are applied automatically on user creation, see <ulink url="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-managing_users_and_groups#s1-users-groups-introduction">the Users and Groups chapter of the System Administrator's Guide</ulink>.

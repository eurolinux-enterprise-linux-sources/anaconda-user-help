		<title>Upgrade or Install?</title>
		<para>
			While automated in-place upgrades are now supported, the support is currently limited to AMD64 and Intel&nbsp;64 systems. If you have an existing installation of a previous release of &PRODUCT; on an IBM Power&nbsp;Systems server, you must perform a clean install to migrate to &PRODUCT;&nbsp;7. A clean install is performed by backing up all data from the system, formatting disk partitions, performing an installation of &PRODUCT; from installation media, and then restoring any user data.

			IBM Power&nbsp;Systems servers offer many options for partitioning, virtual or native devices, and consoles.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you are using a non-partitioned system, you do not need any pre-installation setup. For systems using the HVSI serial console, hook up your console to the T2 serial port.
		</para>
		<para>
			If using a partitioned system the steps to create the partition and start the installation are largely the same. You should create the partition at the HMC and assign some CPU and memory resources, as well as SCSI and Ethernet resources, which can be either virtual or native. The HMC create partition wizard steps you through the creation.
		</para>
		<para>
			For more information on creating the partition, see the <citetitle>Partitioning for Linux with an HMC</citetitle> PDF in the IBM Systems Hardware Information Center at: <ulink url="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/powersys/v3r1m5/topic/iphbi_p5/iphbibook.pdf">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/powersys/v3r1m5/topic/iphbi_p5/iphbibook.pdf</ulink>
		</para>
		<para>
			If you are using virtual SCSI resources, rather than native SCSI, you must configure a 'link' to the virtual SCSI serving partition, and then configure the virtual SCSI serving partition itself. You create a 'link' between the virtual SCSI client and server slots using the HMC. You can configure a virtual SCSI server on either Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) or IBM&nbsp;i, depending on which model and options you have.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you are installing using Intel iSCSI Remote Boot, all attached iSCSI storage devices must be disabled. Otherwise, the installation will succeed but the installed system will not boot.
		</para>
		<para>
			For more information on using virtual devices, see the IBM Redbooks publication <emphasis>Virtualizing an Infrastructure with System p and Linux</emphasis> at: <ulink url="http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247499.html">http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247499.html</ulink>
		</para>

			Once you have your system configured, you need to Activate from the HMC or power it on. Depending on the type of installation, you need to configure SMS to correctly boot the system into the installation program.

			The installation program automatically detects and installs your computer's hardware and you do not usually need to supply the installation program with any specific details about your system. However, when performing certain types of installation, it is important to know specific details about your hardware. For this reason, it is recommended that you record the following system specifications for reference during the installation, depending on your installation type.

					If you plan to use a customized partition layout, record:
				</para>

							The model numbers, sizes, types, and interfaces of the hard drives attached to the system. For example, Seagate ST3320613AS 320 GB on SATA0, Western Digital WD7500AAKS 750 GB on SATA1. This will allow you to identify specific hard drives during the partitioning process.

					If you are installing &PRODUCT; as an additional operating system on an existing system, record:

				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Information about the partitions used on the system. This information can include file system types, device node names, file system labels, and sizes. This will allow you to identify specific partitions during the partitioning process. Remember that different operating systems identify partitions and drives differently, therefore even if the other operating system is a Unix operating system, the device names can be reported by &PRODUCT; differently. This information can usually be found by executing the equivalent of the <command>mount</command> command and <command>blkid</command> command and in the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file.
						</para>
						<para>
							If you have other operating systems already installed, the &PRODUCT;&nbsp;7 installation program attempts to automatically detect and configure to boot them.

		<title>Automating the Installation with Kickstart</title>
		<para>
			&PRODUCT;&nbsp;7 offers a way to partially or fully automate the installation process using a <firstterm>Kickstart file</firstterm>. Kickstart files contain answers to all questions normally asked by the installation program, such as what time zone do you want the system to use, how should the drives be partitioned or which packages should be installed. Providing a prepared Kickstart file at the beginning of the installation therefore allows you to perform the entire installation (or parts of it) automatically, without need for any intervention from the user. This is especially useful when deploying &PRODUCT; on a large number of systems at once.

		<para>
			In addition to allowing you to automate the installation, Kickstart files also provide more options regarding software selection. When installing &PRODUCT; manually using the graphical installation interface, your software selection is limited to pre-defined environments and add-ons. A Kickstart file allows you to install or remove individual packages as well.

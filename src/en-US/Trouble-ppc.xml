		If the installation fails, the messages from these files are consolidated into <filename>/tmp/anaconda-tb-<replaceable>identifier</replaceable></filename>, where <replaceable>identifier</replaceable> is a random string.
	</para>
	<para>
		After successful installation, by default, these files will be copied to the installed system under the directory <filename class="directory">/var/log/anaconda/</filename>. However, if installation is unsuccessful, or if the <option>inst.nosave=all</option> or <option>inst.nosave=logs</option> options are used when booting the installation system, these logs will only exist in the installation program's RAM disk. This means they are not saved permanently and will be lost once the system is powered down. To store them permanently, copy those files to another system on the network by using <command>scp</command> on the system running the installation program, or copy them to a mounted storage device (such as an USB flash drive). Details on how to transfer the log files over the network are below.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			The following procedure requires the installation system to be able to access the network and the target system to be able to receive files over the <systemitem class="protocol">ssh</systemitem> protocol.
		</para>
	</note>
	<procedure>
		<title>Transferring Log Files Over the Network</title>
		<step>
			<para>
				On the system you are installing, press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> to access a shell prompt. You will be logged into a root account and you will have access to the installation program's temporary file system.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Switch to the <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> directory where the log files are located:
			</para>
<screen><prompt>#</prompt> <command>cd /tmp</command></screen>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Copy the log files onto another system on the network using the <command>scp</command> command:
			</para>
<screen><prompt>#</prompt> <command>scp *log <replaceable>user</replaceable>@<replaceable>address</replaceable>:<replaceable>path</replaceable></command></screen>
			<para>
				Replace <replaceable>user</replaceable> with a valid user name on the target system, <replaceable>address</replaceable> with the target system's address or host name, and <replaceable>path</replaceable> with the path to the directory you want to save the log files into. For example, if you want to log in as <systemitem class="username">john</systemitem> to a system with an IP address of <systemitem>192.168.0.122</systemitem> and place the log files into the <filename class="directory">/home/john/logs/</filename> directory on that system, the command will have the following form:
			</para>
<screen><prompt>#</prompt> <command>scp *log john@192.168.0.122:/home/john/logs/</command></screen>
			<para>
				When connecting to the target system for the first time, the SSH client asks you to confirm that the fingerprint of the remote system is correct and that you want to continue:
			</para>
<screen>
<computeroutput>The authenticity of host '192.168.0.122 (192.168.0.122)' can't be established.</computeroutput>
<computeroutput>ECDSA key fingerprint is a4:60:76:eb:b2:d0:aa:23:af:3d:59:5c:de:bb:c4:42.</computeroutput>
<computeroutput>Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</computeroutput>
</screen>
			<para>
				Type <literal>yes</literal> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to continue. Then, provide a valid password when prompted. The files will start transferring to the specified directory on the target system.
			</para>
		</step>
	</procedure>
	<para>
		The log files from the installation are now permanently saved on the target system and available for review.

			<para>
				Systems with some video cards have trouble booting into the graphical installation program. If the installation program does not run using its default settings, it attempts to run in a lower resolution mode. If that still fails, the installation program attempts to run in text mode.

				In some cases, attempting to install in text mode using a serial console will result in no output on the console. This happens on systems which have a graphics card, but no monitor connected. If <application>Anaconda</application> detects a graphics card, it will attempt to use it for a display, even if no display is connected.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you want to perform a text-based installation on a serial console, use the <option>inst.text</option> and <option>console=</option> boot options. See <xref linkend="chap-anaconda-boot-options"/> for more details.

				In the <guilabel>Installation Destination</guilabel> screen, the following error message can appear at the bottom: <guilabel>No disks detected. Please shut down the computer, connect at least one disk, and restart to complete installation</guilabel>.
			</para>
			<para>
				The message indicates that <application>Anaconda</application> did not find any writable storage devices to install to. In that case, first make sure that your system does have at least one storage device attached.
			</para>
			<para>
				If your system uses a hardware RAID controller, verify that the controller is properly configured and working. See your controller's documentation for instructions.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you are installing into one or more iSCSI devices and there is no local storage present on the system, make sure that all required LUNs (<firstterm>Logical Unit Numbers</firstterm>) are being presented to the appropriate HBA (<firstterm>Host Bus Adapter</firstterm>). For additional information about iSCSI, see <xref linkend="appe-iscsi-disks"/>.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you made sure you have a connected and properly configured storage device and the message still appears after you reboot the system and start the installation again, it means that the installation program failed to detect the storage. In most cases this message appears when you attempt to install on an SCSI device which has not been recognized by the installation program.
			</para>
			<para>
				In that case, you will have to perform a driver update before starting the installation. Check your hardware vendor's website to determine if a driver update is available that fixes your problem. For more general information on driver updates, see <xref linkend="chap-driver-updates-ppc"/>.

			<para>
				After you finish the installation and reboot your system for the first time, it is possible that the system stops responding during the graphical boot sequence, requiring a reset. In this case, the boot loader is displayed successfully, but selecting any entry and attempting to boot the system results in a halt. This usually means a problem with the graphical boot sequence; to solve this issue, you must disable graphical boot. To do this, temporarily alter the setting at boot time before changing it permanently.
			</para>
			<procedure>
				<title>Disabling Graphical Boot Temporarily</title>
				<step>
					<para>
						Start your computer and wait until the boot loader menu appears. If you set your boot loader timeout period to 0, hold down the <keycap>Esc</keycap> key to access it.
					</para>
				</step>

						When the boot loader menu appears, use your cursor keys to highlight the entry you want to boot and press the <keycap>e</keycap> key to edit this entry's options.
					</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>
						In the list of options, find the kernel line - that is, the line beginning with the keyword <literal>linux</literal>. On this line, locate the <literal>rhgb</literal> option and delete it. The option might not be immediately visible; use the cursor keys to scroll up and down.
					</para>
				</step>

						Press <keycap>F10</keycap> or <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>X</keycap></keycombo> to boot your system with the edited options.
					</para>
				</step>
			</procedure>
			<para>
				If the system started successfully, you can log in normally. Then you will need to disable the graphical boot permanently - otherwise you will have to perform the previous procedure every time the system boots. To permanently change boot options, do the following.
			</para>
			<procedure>
				<title>Disabling Graphical Boot Permanently</title>

/boot/vmlinuz-3.10.0-229.4.2.el7.ppc64</screen>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>
						Use the <application>grubby</application> tool to remove the <literal>rhgb</literal> boot option from the default kernel, identified in the last step, in your <application>GRUB2</application> configuration. For example:
					</para>
<screen><prompt>#</prompt> grubby --remove-args="rhgb" --update-kernel <replaceable>/boot/vmlinuz-3.10.0-229.4.2.el7.ppc64</replaceable></screen>
				</step>
			</procedure>
			<para>
				After you finish this procedure, you can reboot your computer. &PRODUCT; will not use the graphical boot sequence any more. If you want to enable graphical boot in the future, follow the same procedure, replacing the <literal>--remove-args="rhgb"</literal> parameter with the <literal>--args="rhgb"</literal> paramter. This will restore the <literal>rhgb</literal> boot option to the default kernel in your <application>GRUB2</application> configuration.

				If you have installed the <application>X Window System</application> but are not seeing a graphical desktop environment once you log into your system, you can start it manually using the <command>startx</command> command. Note, however, that this is just a one-time fix and does not change the log in process for future log ins.

			<para>
				If you are having trouble with the <application>X</application> server crashing when a user logs in, one or more of your file systems can be full or nearly full. To verify that this is the problem you are experiencing, execute the following command:
			</para>
<screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>df -h</command></screen>
			<para>
				The output will help you diagnose which partition is full - in most cases, the problem will be on the <filename>/home</filename> partition. The following is a sample output of the <command>df</command> command:
			</para>
<screen>
Filesystem                                  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on

</screen>
			<para>
				In the above example, you can see that the <filename>/home</filename> partition is full, which causes the crash. You can make some room on the partition by removing unneeded files. After you free up some disk space, start <application>X</application> using the <command>startx</command> command.

			</indexterm>


			<para>
				A signal 11 error, commonly known as a <firstterm>segmentation fault</firstterm>, means that a program accessed a memory location that was not assigned to it. A signal 11 error can occur due to a bug in one of the software programs that is installed, or faulty hardware.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you receive a fatal signal 11 error during the installation, first make sure you are using the most recent installation images, and let <application>Anaconda</application> verify them to make sure they are not corrupted. Bad installation media (such as an improperly burned or scratched optical disk) are a common cause of signal 11 errors. Verifying the integrity of the installation media is recommended before every installation.
			</para>
			<para>
				For information about obtaining the most recent installation media, see <xref linkend="chap-download-red-hat-enterprise-linux"/>. To perform a media check before the installation starts, append the <option>rd.live.check</option> boot option at the boot menu. See <xref linkend="sect-boot-options-mediacheck"/> for details.
			</para>

				Other possible causes are beyond this document's scope. Consult your hardware manufacturer's documentation for more information.

				If you are experiencing difficulties when trying to IPL from Network Storage Space (*NWSSTG), in most cases the reason is a missing <systemitem>PReP</systemitem> partition. In this case, you must reinstall the system and make sure to create this partition during the partitioning phase or in the Kickstart file.

			<para>
				IBM Power System users booting their virtual environment with SLOF firmware must manually unset the <literal>next_entry</literal> grub environment variable after a system reboot. The SLOF firmware does not support block writes at boot time by design thus the bootloader is unable to clear this variable at boot time.
